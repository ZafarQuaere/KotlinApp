** A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single,
    related action.

1) Functions allow us to break the program into a bunch of steps and substeps
2) Functions encourages code reuse
3) Functions, if used properly, help us keep the code clean, organized, and easy to understand
4) Functions make testing (unit testing) easy, testing each small part of the program is easier
   than the complete program in a single go
