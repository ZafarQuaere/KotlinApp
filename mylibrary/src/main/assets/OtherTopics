Mutexes
A Mutex (mutual exclusion) object allows access to multiple coroutines to share the same resource
but not simultaneously:

Actors
An actor is kind of object that interacts with other actors and with the external world through
messages

An actor object can have a private internal mutable state that can be modified and
accessed externally through messages, but not directly.
